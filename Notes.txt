To make feature files from the CukeHead mind map:

bin/cukehead cuke -m mm/CukeHead.mm

----------------------------------------------------------------------

To run RSpec and see HTML output:

spec -fh spec/*_spec.rb > /tmp/specs.html && firefox /tmp/specs.html

Created project tree using newgem and removed a few things it made 
such as LICENSE (add one later), TODO (I'll use Notes.txt instead),
'scripts' directory. 

I edited the Rakefile but I don't know that I'll be actually building
a gem with this.

[2010-04-30]

Added 'features' directory and started feature_reader.feature. 
Obviously I am not yet a cukehead. I'm having trouble writing it.
