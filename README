== cukehead

=== Introduction

Cukehead provides hours (well, maybe a couple minutes) of fun
exploring Cucumber feature files in the form of FreeMind mind 
maps. If you want to create feature files based on a mind map
it can do that too but I'm not sure anyone will want to do 
that.

Cukehead is the result of the author wanting to learn how Cucumber works
in preparation for a Rails project during the same period of time he was
exploring mind mapping software in a questionable attempt to become more
organized. Somehow the two came together as an exercise to learn how to
build a Ruby application.


=== Usage

cukehead command [options]

command:
  map
      Read Cucumber feature files and create a FreeMind mind map file.

  cuke
      Read a FreeMind mind map file and create Cucumber feature files.

options:
  -o or --overwrite
      Overwrite existing output file(s).

  -m FILENAME or --mm-filename FILENAME
      map: Name of output file (default is mm/cukehead-output.mm).

  -f PATH or --features-path PATH
      map: Directory containing feature files to read (default is directory
      named 'features' in current directory).

      cuke: Directory feature files  will be written to.

  -s FILENAME or --source-mm FILENAME
      map: FreeMind mind map file to use as a template for creating
      the output file. If the template contains a node with the text
      'Cucumber features:' then the feature nodes will be inserted there.
